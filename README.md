# Spotify Code Generator

I saw videos on TikTok where some people try to draw Spotify code. I wanted to create my Spotify code on the computer instead of drawing. 

This program visualizes Spotify code lists and creates random Spotify codes.

_The bad news is that it doesn't work on random Spotify codes because random Spotify code needs URI and media reference connection. Couldn't figure it out yet. I wrote a **[blog post](https://ozgecinko.medium.com/spotify-kodlar%C4%B1n%C4%B1-i%CC%87nceleyelim-af4a96d7f434)** about that. You can reach me at there or you can contact me._
