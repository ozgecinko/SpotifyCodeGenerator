# Random Spotify Code Generator

I saw videos on TikTok where some people try to draw random Spotify code. I wanted to create my random Spotify code on the computer instead of drawing. _The bad news is that it **doesn't open any song** because there is a non-random algorithm for music codes but, I haven't been able to figure it out yet._
